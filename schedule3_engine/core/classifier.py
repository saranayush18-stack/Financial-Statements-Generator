"""
Ledger Classification Engine (rule-based, keyword matching).

Given a ledger name, suggests a Schedule III mapping using the ordered
keyword rules in data/classification_rules.py. This is intentionally
transparent and debuggable -- every suggestion can be traced back to the
exact rule and keyword that fired, which matters when a CA has to defend a
classification to a reviewing partner or auditor.

Design choice (per user preference): rule-based keyword matching, not an
LLM call, so classification is instant, free, deterministic, and works
fully offline. The MappingStore (mapping_store.py) persists user overrides
per company, so once a firm corrects a ledger's mapping, the engine will
never ask about that exact ledger name again for that company.
